Neuro-Orchestrator for Smart City & Autonomous Transport
Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Neuro-Orchestrator for Smart City & Autonomous Transport" project. This is a global, integrated B2B platform designed to serve as the centralized "brain" for managing all aspects of a future-forward smart city. The platform will orchestrate autonomous transport (cars, drone taxis, delivery bots), robotic services (automated restaurants, infrastructure maintenance), and much more.

The core of the system is a multi-layered architecture of AI agents that aggregates and analyzes real-time data from a vast network of sources, including IoT sensors, drones, and satellites. A key innovation is the integration of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to create a seamless and optimized interaction between humans and the urban ecosystem.
Goal

The primary goal is to develop a self-organizing, adaptive, and resilient urban ecosystem. The platform aims not just to automate city management but to create a system that can intelligently respond to dynamic changes, predict future needs, and optimize operations with minimal human intervention. It is designed with a human-centric approach, using BCI and VR/AR to augment human capabilities rather than replace them.
Key Technologies

This project will leverage a combination of cutting-edge technologies:

    Internet of Things (IoT): For city-wide sensor data collection.

    AI & Machine Learning:

        Large Language Models (LLMs): e.g., Mistral AI, for the central "City Orchestrator".

        Agentic AI Frameworks: e.g., CrewAI, for specialized agent teams.

        Predictive Analytics & Optimization Algorithms.

    Big Data Processing:

        Real-time Stream Processing: Apache Flink, Spark Streaming.

        Distributed Databases.

    Brain-Computer Interface (BCI): For advanced human-system interaction.

    VR/AR: For immersive simulation, training, and maintenance overlays.

    Cloud Computing: For scalability, processing power, and reliability.

    Cybersecurity: To protect critical city infrastructure and data.
